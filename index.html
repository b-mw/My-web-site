            <em> Africa is renowned for its exceptional wildlife and natural beauty. <br>
            Elephants are remarkable for their size and strength, intelligence, and<br> 
            complex social structures.Gorillas are gentle giants found in the forests <br>
            of Central and East Africa, and are among the closest living relatives of<br> 
            humans. Lions, leopards, and cheetahs are known for their impressive hunting <br>
             skills and striking beauty. African landscapes themselves are breathtakingly <br>
              beautiful, from the vast deserts of the Sahara to the lush forests of the Congo Basin. <br>
            Despite the many challenges facing Africa's wildlife, there is still much to celebrate <br> 
            and appreciate about this remarkable continent. Visiting Africa's national parks and <br> 
            wildlife reserves can help to support conservation efforts and ensure that these incredible<br>
             animals continue to thrive for generations to come.</em> </p>
